Progento_Checkoutpromocodes
===============================

Magento module to allow customers to apply a promo code directly in the checkout

Overview
-----------
Out of the box, Magento doesn't allow for applying a promo code as part of the checkout. This plugin fixes that!

Install
--------
Simply extract the files and copy them into your Magento install. All the blocks and js are inserted automatically.
